			 	<h1>In defense of dynamic finders</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 3, 2013</span>
			      <p>Last week I had a discussion with a colleague (and talented ruby developer) about the decision to remove dynamic finders from ActiveRecord. This is old news and I&rsquo;m sure has been hashed to death, but I figured I&rsquo;d chime in with a few thoughts, now that Rails 4.0 is out and we&rsquo;re moving towards 4.1.</p>

<p>Not long ago, the dynamic finders code was moved into its own gem. This is in sync with the component philosophy that started around Rails 3. It is currently a dependency of ActiveRecord - If you want AR, you still get your finders. Coming up in 4.1 however, you&rsquo;ll have to add it to your Gemfile. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3cc7223f3d57f31affdbabccc86cbc8b6589e2c8" target="window">the commit</a>.</p>

<p>This will hold us over til Rails 5, when the deprecated finders gem will no longer be supported - from the <a href="https://github.com/rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders/blob/master/README.md" target="window">second sentence of its README</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It will be removed as a dependency in Rails 4.1, but users can manually
include it in their Gemfile and it will continue to be maintained until Rails 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a hard time finding historical discourse over dynamic finders and their eventual consignment to death row. Most references I found were about the fact that they were going away and discussions about how to arrange Arel syntax to match dynamic finder behavior. I did find one nugget, which I&rsquo;ll get into below.</p>

<h1 id="the-good">The good</h1>

<p>Dyamic finders were born out of necessity. Rails was designed to change web development from a slow, pain-ridden process into something fun and productive again. Dynamic
finders fit into this by giving us a familiar vocabulary when working with a database.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by_subject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;What is your favorite color?&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span></span>  <span class="k">Select</span> <span class="o">*</span>
    <span class="k">From</span> <span class="n">posts</span>
    <span class="k">Where</span> <span class="n">subject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;What is your favorite color?&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Compared to raw SQL, dynamic finders give us a dense, readable syntax. With this in mind, I&rsquo;m delighted that Rails has provided these finders.</p>

<h1 id="the-bad">The bad</h1>

<p>Despite it&rsquo;s advantages, one can rapidly hit a wall when querying multiple fields.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by_name_and_title_and_quest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Arthur&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;King of the Britons&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Holy Grail&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Or &hellip;</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by_parent_id_and_orinal_and_is_active</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Given enough facets and long enough field names, dynamic finders rapidly lose their readability. They are also limited - one cannot easily query on the negation of a boolean or query using the SQL &ldquo;LIKE&rdquo; clause.</p>

<h1 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h1>

<p>Under the hood, damning evidence can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.15.rc2/activerecord/lib/active_record/dynamic_matchers.rb" target="window">ActiveRecord source code</a>. Dynamic finders are implemented via method_missing. While flexible, method_missing isn&rsquo;t terribly performance friendly. Having never looked into this before, I was a bit surprised to see this.</p>

<p>I previously thought ActiveRecord evaluated the table structure at load-time and generated various finder methods based on fields from the table. In retrospect, I see that would&rsquo;ve been a horrible option considering the number of permutations in a table with many fields.</p>

<h1 id="they-aren-t-really-gone">They aren&rsquo;t really gone</h1>

<p>Consider this from the <a href="https://github.com/rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders/blob/master/README.md" target="window">deprecated finders</a> gem README:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that find(primary_key), find_by&hellip;, and
find_by&hellip;! are not deprecated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So find and find_by are not going away&hellip; that helps considerably - here&rsquo;s what DHH had to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/8loq2zXLoPQ" target="window">say on the matter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the new dynamic finders are just as good as before:
          Product.find_by title: &ldquo;iPad Mini&rdquo;
is just as well as:
          Product.find_by_title &ldquo;iPad Mini&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty much what got me on board. This isn&rsquo;t so bad:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by</span> <span class="ss">:subject</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;What is your favorite color?&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I am still quite accustomed to the the old hash syntax, but I admit it is clumsy compared to the new hash syntax in this case:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by</span> <span class="ss">subject</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;What is your favorite color?&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I can definitely live with this. The only counter-argument I can see is dynamic finder methods use snake_case&hellip; just like most other variables and methods in Ruby. I am quite, quite, used to snake_case - the find_by method brakes the snake case flow as I type. This is just a nit and something easily overcome using snippets in my editor.</p>

<p>So where does that leave us? I think find_by will be a sufficient replacement for dynamic finders. Syntactically, it is quite similar and should yield much better performance.</p>

<p>The one part of dynamic finders I will truly miss is find_by_id. I frequently use this in edit and destroy actions to better handle the case where an invalid id is provided. find_by_id returns a nil, rather than raising an exception. I may end up creating some sort of mixin like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">IdFinder</span>
    <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">ActiveSupport</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Concern</span>

    <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">ClassMethods</span>
      <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_by_id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by</span> <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">id</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>And just add it to the top of my model classes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span>  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Knight</span>
    <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">IdFinder</span>

     <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_ni!</span>
       <span class="o">...</span> <span class="n">etc</span> <span class="o">...</span>
     <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m OK with the fate of dynamic finders. They are useful, but there is a reasonable replacement strategy. It will be interesting to see what happens when Rails 5 rolls around. The deprecated finders gem will be unsupported by then, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a maintainer (or a group of maintainers) won&rsquo;t keep it going. Or maybe not - <a href="https://github.com/datanoise/actionwebservice" target="window">remember ActionWebService</a>?</p>
